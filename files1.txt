King Dasharatha, the king of Ayodhya, had three queens - Kaushalya, Kaikeyi, and Sumitra. Kaikeyi had once saved King Dasharatha’s life during a battle. He was so grateful that he promised her two boons—special wishes she could ask for anytime. Kaikeyi didn’t use the boons then and kept them for the future.


One day, the king decided to crown his eldest son, Prince Ram (Kaushalya’s son), as the next king. Everyone in the kingdom was happy, but Kaikeyi’s maid, Manthara, had other plans. Manthara told Kaikeyi that if Ram became king, her son Bharat would never rule Ayodhya. She filled Kaikeyi’s mind with fear and jealousy.


Listening to Manthara, Kaikeyi went to King Dasharath and reminded him of the two boons. The king assured Kaikeyi that he would fulfill his promise. 


Kaikeyi’s first boon was to send Ram Ji to the forest for 14 years. Her second boon was to make Bharat, her son, the king of Ayodhya. Hearing this, the king was heartbroken, but he had to keep his promise.


Bharat, however, was very upset when he learned about his mother’s actions. Kaikeyi soon realized her mistake. She felt very sad for causing so much pain to her family.


In the end, she learned that love and selflessness are more important than power.
