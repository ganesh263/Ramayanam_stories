King Dasharatha, the king of Ayodhya, had three queens - Kaushalya, Kaikeyi, and Sumitra. Kaikeyi had once saved King Dasharatha’s life during a battle. He was so grateful that he promised her two boons—special wishes she could ask for anytime. Kaikeyi didn’t use the boons then and kept them for the future.


One day, the king decided to crown his eldest son, Prince Ram (Kaushalya’s son), as the next king. Everyone in the kingdom was happy, but Kaikeyi’s maid, Manthara, had other plans. Manthara told Kaikeyi that if Ram became king, her son Bharat would never rule Ayodhya. She filled Kaikeyi’s mind with fear and jealousy.


Listening to Manthara, Kaikeyi went to King Dasharath and reminded him of the two boons. The king assured Kaikeyi that he would fulfill his promise. 


Kaikeyi’s first boon was to send Ram Ji to the forest for 14 years. Her second boon was to make Bharat, her son, the king of Ayodhya. Hearing this, the king was heartbroken, but he had to keep his promise.


Bharat, however, was very upset when he learned about his mother’s actions. Kaikeyi soon realized her mistake. She felt very sad for causing so much pain to her family.


In the end, she learned that love and selflessness are more important than power.

Prince Lakshman, the younger brother of Shri Ram, loved and respected his elder brother Shri Ram deeply. When Shri Ram was sent to the forest for 14 years, Lakshman decided to go with him. He wanted to serve and protect his brother and sister-in-law, Devi Sita.


Before leaving for the forest, Lakshman made a special wish to Nidra Devi, the Goddess of Sleep.


He asked her, “Please take away my sleep for 14 years so I can stay awake and take care of Shri Ram and Devi Sita without getting tired.”


Nidra Devi agreed however, she said that someone must sleep in his place.


Lakshman’s wife, Urmila, lovingly offered to take his place. She stayed back in the palace and slept for the entire 14 years so that Lakshman could remain awake and fulfill his duties without being tired.


In the forest, Lakshman built huts, gathered food, and guarded them day and night. He never thought about his comfort. While Shri Ram and Sita Mata rested, Lakshman stayed awake with his bow and arrows to protect them from wild animals and dangers.


Lakshman’s selfless love and sacrifice showed that true devotion and love is keeping others' needs before your own.
