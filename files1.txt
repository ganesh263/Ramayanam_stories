King Dasharatha, the king of Ayodhya, had three queens - Kaushalya, Kaikeyi, and Sumitra. Kaikeyi had once saved King Dasharatha’s life during a battle. He was so grateful that he promised her two boons—special wishes she could ask for anytime. Kaikeyi didn’t use the boons then and kept them for the future.


One day, the king decided to crown his eldest son, Prince Ram (Kaushalya’s son), as the next king. Everyone in the kingdom was happy, but Kaikeyi’s maid, Manthara, had other plans. Manthara told Kaikeyi that if Ram became king, her son Bharat would never rule Ayodhya. She filled Kaikeyi’s mind with fear and jealousy.


Listening to Manthara, Kaikeyi went to King Dasharath and reminded him of the two boons. The king assured Kaikeyi that he would fulfill his promise. 


Kaikeyi’s first boon was to send Ram Ji to the forest for 14 years. Her second boon was to make Bharat, her son, the king of Ayodhya. Hearing this, the king was heartbroken, but he had to keep his promise.


Bharat, however, was very upset when he learned about his mother’s actions. Kaikeyi soon realized her mistake. She felt very sad for causing so much pain to her family.


In the end, she learned that love and selflessness are more important than power.

Prince Lakshman, the younger brother of Shri Ram, loved and respected his elder brother Shri Ram deeply. When Shri Ram was sent to the forest for 14 years, Lakshman decided to go with him. He wanted to serve and protect his brother and sister-in-law, Devi Sita.


Before leaving for the forest, Lakshman made a special wish to Nidra Devi, the Goddess of Sleep.


He asked her, “Please take away my sleep for 14 years so I can stay awake and take care of Shri Ram and Devi Sita without getting tired.”


Nidra Devi agreed however, she said that someone must sleep in his place.


Lakshman’s wife, Urmila, lovingly offered to take his place. She stayed back in the palace and slept for the entire 14 years so that Lakshman could remain awake and fulfill his duties without being tired.


In the forest, Lakshman built huts, gathered food, and guarded them day and night. He never thought about his comfort. While Shri Ram and Sita Mata rested, Lakshman stayed awake with his bow and arrows to protect them from wild animals and dangers.


Lakshman’s selfless love and sacrifice showed that true devotion and love is keeping others' needs before your own.

A long time ago, in the forests of Panchavati, in India, there lived a mighty and kind bird named Jatayu. Jatayu met Shri Ram, Sita Maa and Lakshman when they were on their exile. When Jatayu saw Shri Ram, he recognized him immediately. However, Ram ji thought of the bird as a demon and asked the bird to introduce himself.


Jatayu introduced himself and told Shri Ram about his friendship with King Dasharath. He promised to protect Devi Sita and help them during their stay in the forest.


Jatayu was old but very brave and always stood for what was right.


One day, the demon king Ravan forcefully took Sita Mata away on his flying chariot. Sita Mata cried for help, and Jatayu heard her. Even though he was old, Jatayu decided to stop Ravan and save Devi Sita. He fought with all his strength, scratching and pecking Ravan to make him release Sita Mata. But Ravan was very powerful. He struck Jatayu with his sword and injured him badly.


Jatayu fell to the ground, weak and in pain. Later, Shri Ram and Lakshman found him. Jatayu used his last breath to tell them about Ravan and the direction he had gone.
Once, when Shri Ram, Devi Sita, and Lakshman were living in the Panchavati forest, the demon king Ravan came in disguise. He tricked Sita Maa by pretending to be a poor Brahman and kidnapped her while Shri Rama and Lakshmana were away.


Ravan carried Devi Sita away in his flying chariot. She was scared but thought quickly. She decided to leave clues for Shri Ram so he could find her.


As the chariot flew over the forest, Sita Maa threw her jewellery, one piece at a time, on the ground. She threw her earrings, bangles, and even part of her necklace. She hoped Shri Ram would follow the trail and rescue her.


Soon, Shri Ram and Lakshman returned to the hut and found Sita Maa missing. While searching for her, they met Jatayu, who told them about Ravan’s evil act. Then, as they walked further, they found her ornaments on the ground. These clues helped them understand the direction in which Ravan had taken her. Finally, Shri Ram reached Lanka and rescued Sita.


Devi Sita’s quick thinking and intelligence helped showed Shri Ram find and rescue her. Her actions teach us to stay calm and use our minds, even in difficult situations.



Jatayu’s story teaches us about courage, selflessness, and standing by the truth, even in difficult times.

Kumbhkaran, the elder brother of Ravan, was known for his enormous size and great strength. He once fought a powerful battle against Indra Dev, the king of the gods. He had crushed Indra Dev’s army and even captured Indra himself! When Kumbhkaran and his brothers performed prayers to gain boons from Brahma Ji, he wanted to ask Bhagwan Brahma for the throne of Indra Dev.


The gods were very worried about Kumbhkaran’s intentions and growing strength. If he became even more powerful, he could destroy Deva Loka. To stop him, Goddess Saraswati played a trick. When Kumbhkarana asked for his boon, Saraswati made him say the wrong words. Instead of asking for Indra Dev’s throne (Indraasan), he accidentally asked for a long, deep sleep (Nidraasan).


Brahma Ji granted the boon, and Kumbhkarana was cursed to sleep forever.


This curse made Ravana feel helpless during the battles, as the strong and brave Kumbhkaran would be asleep. Ravana requested Brahma Ji to do something about it.


Brahma Ji agreed and said that Kumbhkaran would sleep for six months and wake up for only one day and, after satisfying his hunger, will sleep again.


This story teaches us to think carefully before we speak or ask for something, as mistakes can lead to unexpected results.
